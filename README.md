## Projects
### Artamis Programming Language
#### TODO: Shortenand move to website description
Artamis is an amorphous JIT (just in time) programming language designed for developing and Automating a variety of Information Systems. It uses common Lexer and Parser notation to build and run a task specific programming language compiler for project specific languages. It can be used to parse existinge file formats - such as Markdown, XML, or JSON - but it can also create or parse unique file formats. Artamis can also be used to run code segments inside of a static file to transform its contents on read.
It has be used for many different applications such as: Machine Learning, Automated Video Editing, Content Generation, Video Game Development,
A web portal to try the Artamis Programming Language is still under development, however more information can be found at: [artamis.ca](https://artamis.ca/about/artamis)
